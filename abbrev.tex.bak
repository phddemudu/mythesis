% If abbreviations and acronyms (e.g. MARDI, UPM) are used in the   %
% thesis, they should be explained in a List of Abbreviations, even %
% though the full names are given when the terms are first          %
% mentioned in the text. This list should be the last item in the   %
% preliminary section. It serves as a ready reference to readers    %
% not familiar with the abbreviations used in the thesis.           %
% Universally recognised scientific symbols (such as cm, mm, kg)    %
% need not be listed.                                               %
